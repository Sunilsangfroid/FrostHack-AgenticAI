# **Autonomous Agents with Heurist.ai**

This is the project for **FrostHack 2025**. Weâ€™re building **autonomous AI agents** using the **Heurist Agent Framework**, and our agents need to be capable of a few core tasks, like processing natural language, generating images, and handling voice interactions, all across platforms like **Telegram**, **Discord**, or **Twitter**.

## What Weâ€™re Building

Weâ€™re creating agents that can:
- **Deploy on platforms**: Make your agent work on Telegram, Discord, or Twitter.
- **Process natural language**: Use large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate human language.
- **Generate images**: Use AI models to create high-quality images.

### The Only Rule:
You *must* use the **Heurist Agent Framework** to build everything. Other than that, itâ€™s up to you how you choose to approach the problem. 

## Project Structure

- `agents/`: Contains the implementation of various autonomous agents.
- `bots/`: Includes bot-specific code for different platforms.
- `clients/`: Houses client-side applications and interfaces.
- `config/`: Configuration files for setting up the environment and parameters.
- `core/`: Core functionalities and utilities shared across the project.
- `interfaces/`: Defines interfaces for interaction between different modules.
- `media/`: Assets and media files used within the project.
- `video_generator/`: Module dedicated to generating videos using AI models.
- `.envexample`: Example environment configuration file.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `embeddings.db`: Database file containing embeddings for various models.
- `main_app.py`: Main application script to run the project.
- `main_script.py`: Primary script executing core functionalities.
- `main_telegram.py`: Telegram-specific main script for deploying the agent.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saurbh264/FrostHack-AgenticAI.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd FrostHack-AgenticAI
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Rename `.envexample` to `.env`.
   - Update the `.env` file with appropriate configuration values.
5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main_app.py
   ```
6. **(Optional) Google Colab**
   If you're facing issue in seting up locally, you can setup it on Google Colab using:
   ```bash
      !git clone https://github.com/saurbh264/FrostHack-AgenticAI.git
      %cd FrostHack-AgenticAI/
      !pip install -r requirements.txt
      !python main_script.py
   ```
